\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .TEX manuscript file and all
figures (which should be in EPS format, or PDF format if you are using
PDF-\LaTeX) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package. Prism, OSA's article tracking
system, will process in \LaTeX mode by default but will use PDF-\LaTeX if PDF
figure files are detected. Note: TAR or TAR-GZIP is no longer required. All
files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps},
not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there is video or other multimedia, the
associated files should be uploaded separately.
