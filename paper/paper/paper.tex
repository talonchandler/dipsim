  We investigate the use of polarized illumination in multiview microscopes for
  determining the orientation of single molecules. First, we relate the
  orientation of single molecules to measurable intensities in multiview
  microscopes and develop an information theoretic metric---the solid angle
  uncertainty---to compare the ability of multiview microscopes to estimate the
  orientation of single molecules. Next, we compare a broad class of microscopes
  using this metric---single- and dual-view microscopes with varying
  illumination polarization, illumination numerical aperture (NA), detection NA,
  obliquity, asymmetry, and exposure. We find that multiview microscopes are
  better at determining the orientation of single molecules than single-view
  microscopes. We also find that choosing a small illumination NA and a large
  detection NA are good design choices, multiview widefield microscopes can
  benefit from oblique illumination and detection, and asymmetric NA microscopes
  can benefit from exposure asymmetry.

\section{Introduction}
The orientation of single molecules is a valuable reporter for biological
processes. By imaging biological samples with fluorescent probes that are fixed
to known structures, researchers have studied the dynamics of motor proteins
\cite{peterman2001, forkey2003}, DNA \cite{backer2016}, actin \cite{mehta2016},
septin \cite{demay2011, mcquilken2017}, and membranes \cite{anantharam2010}. The
number of techniques available to biologists for measuring the orientation of
single molecules in live cells is continually expanding. We follow a recent
review \cite{backlund2014} and compare three major categories of single molecule
orientation determination techniques:

\textbf{Spatial variation of emission} techniques image single molecules and use
the spatial distribution of intensity in the back focal plane \cite{lieb2004} or
in the image plane \cite{backer2014} to estimate their orientation. The best
techniques in this category use defocusing or phase masks in the back focal
plane to encode orientation and position information in the image
\cite{agrawal2012}. These techniques can estimate the orientation of
molecules in all orientations and only require a single frame, but they
require complex reconstruction algorithms, expensive high numerical aperture
(NA) optics, and sensitive detectors. 

\textbf{Spatial variation of illumination polarization} techniques vary the
polarization and intensity in the illumination path to excite molecules in
specific orientations in the focal volume \cite{debarre2004}. Although these
techniques can accurately estimate the orientation of molecules in all
orientations, they require scanning which makes these techniques too slow for
live cell imaging.

\textbf{Polarized illumination or detection} techniques exploit the anisotropic
absorption and emission pattern of single molecules to estimate their
orientation. By measuring the total intensity in the detector plane during
several polarization orientations on the illumination or detection path, the
orientation of the molecule can be estimated. These techniques are easy to
implement---changing the illumination or detection polarization is simple with a
polarization splitter \cite{mehta2016} or universal compensator
\cite{oldenbourg1995}---and the reconstruction methods are straightforward
\cite{fourkas2001, mehta2016, backer2016}. The main drawback is speed---these
techniques require the collection of several polarization frames to find the
orientation of a single molecule. Despite the requirement for multiple frames,
polarized illumination is the method of choice for live cell imaging because of
its good combination of speed and ease of implementation. For these reasons,
polarized illumination is the method we consider and extend in this paper.

All single molecule orientation determination methods suffer from some degree of
anisotropic orientation uncertainty, i.e., molecules in some orientations
cannot be oriented as well as molecules in others. In some cases the
orientation cannot be determined at all---the forward model can be degenerate
for specific dipole orientations \cite{fourkas2001, lu2008}. We feel that the
importance of isotropic orientation uncertainty has been underappreciated. To
our knowledge, the only authors who have considered anisotropic orientation
uncertainty have only analyzed a small set of molecule orientations intead of
all orientations \cite{agrawal2012}. Our view is that an ideal technique for
determining the orientation of single molecules can reconstruct the
orientation with a small and nearly uniform uncertainty for all molecule
orientations.

Recently, there has been increasing interest in multiview microscopy techniques
for biological imaging \cite{wu2013, keller2015, wu2016, wu2017}. Multiview
microscopes address two key limitations of single view microscopes. First,
multiview microscopes can achieve nearly isotropic resolution compared to the
poor axial resolution of single view microscopes. Second, multiview microscopes
can easily incorporate selective illumination to reduce phototoxicity. For
example, compare light-sheet illumination to wide-field illumination where
most of the illumination light excites out of focus molecules. These
advantages make multiview microscopes good candidates for imaging live
biological specimens for long periods.

In this work we explore the use of polarized illumination in multiview
microscopes for determining the orientation of single molecules. Existing
multiview microscopes can easily be outfitted with fast-switching polarizers
that do not degrade image quality, so polarized illumination is a natural way to
augment multiview microscopes for measuring the orientation of single
molecules. Furthermore, multiview microscopes can achieve nearly isotropic
resolution while delivering selective illumination. We hypothesize that
multiview microscopes will also provide a small and uniform orientation
uncertainty for single molecules in all orientations. In section \ref{methods}
we develop the required theory for polarized illumination microscopy and develop
information theoretic metrics to compare multiview microscopes. In section
\ref{results} we compare the results for a wide range of multiview microscope
designs. Finally, in section \ref{discussion} we discuss the results and their
impact on polarized multiview microscope design.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}
In this section we develop a method to compare multiview polarized illumination
microscopes for the task of reconstructing molecular orientations. In sections
\ref{excitation}--\ref{forward} we develop the forward model for single-frame
microscopes with a fixed illumination and detection configuration. In section
\ref{designs} we list a variety of ways that single-frame microscopes can be
combined to create experimentally realizable multi-frame microscopes. Finally,
in section \ref{metrics} we develop metrics that we will use to compare
multi-frame microscopes.

\subsection{Absorption Efficiency}\label{excitation}
Consider polarized widefield K\"ohler illumination incident on a single
molecule at the focal point with the optical axis along the $\mh{z}$ axis. In
this section we will calculate the \emph{absorption efficiency} in this
geometry---the fraction of the incident power that is absorbed by the molecule.

We start with the unit electric field transmitted by the polarizer,
\begin{align}
 \hat{\mb{E}}_{\text{exc}} = \cos\phi_{\text{exc}}\hat{\mb{x}} +
\sin\phi_{\text{exc}}\hat{\mb{y}},\label{eq:excfield}
\end{align}
where $\phi_{\text{exc}}$ is the angle between the transmission axis of the
excitation polarizer and the $\mh{x}$ axis. Next, we model the action of the an
ideal, aplanatic, polarization preserving illumination objective by multiplying
the electric field vector by a direction dependent rotation matrix,
  \begin{align}
  \mb{R}(\mh{r}) &= \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta\cos^2\phi + \sin^2\phi & (\cos\theta -1)\sin\phi\cos\phi & -\sin\theta\cos\phi\\ (\cos\theta - 1)\sin\phi\cos\phi & \cos\theta\sin^2\phi + \cos^2\phi & -\sin\theta\sin\phi \\ \sin\theta\cos\phi& \sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align}
  where
  \begin{align}
   \hat{\mb{r}} = \sin\theta\cos\phi\hat{\mb{x}} + \sin\theta\sin\phi\hat{\mb{y}} + \cos\theta\hat{\mb{z}} 
  \end{align}
  is a unit vector that points from the origin to the point where the incident
  electric field intersects the Gaussian sphere of the illumination
  objective. Next, we find the power that excites the molecule by taking the
  dot product of the rotated incident field $\mb{R}(\mh{r})\mh{E}_{\text{exc}}$
  and the absorption dipole moment
\begin{align}
  \hat{\bs{\mu}}_{\text{abs}} = \sin\Theta\cos\Phi\hat{\mb{x}} + \sin\Theta\sin\Phi\hat{\mb{y}} + \cos\Theta\hat{\mb{z}}
\end{align}
then taking its modulus squared. If the incident fields are spatially incoherent
then we can find the total power that excites the molecule by integrating over the
illuminated region of the Gaussian sphere $\Omega$ where
\begin{align}
  \Omega &= \{\phi, \theta\ |\ 0 < \phi \leq 2\pi, 0 < \theta \leq \alpha\}, \\
  \alpha &= \arcsin\left(\frac{\text{NA}}{n}\right), \label{eq:alpha}
\end{align}
NA is the illumination numerical aperture, and $n$ is the index of refraction of
the medium.

Finally, we find the fraction of the incident power absorbed by the molecule
by dividing the total absorbed power by the total incident power. The complete
expression for the absorption efficiency in vector notation is
\begin{align}
  \eta_{\text{abs}} = \frac{\int_{\Omega}d\mh{r}|\hat{\bs{\mu}}_{\text{abs}}\cdot\mb{R}(\mh{r})\mh{E}_{\text{exc}}|^2}{\int_{\Omega}d\mh{r}}\label{eq:abs}. 
\end{align}

We substitute equations \ref{eq:excfield}--\ref{eq:alpha} into equation
\ref{eq:abs}, evaluate the integrals, and simplify to express the absorption
efficiency in scalar notation as
\begin{align}
  \eta_{\text{abs}} &= D\{A + B\sin^{2}{\Theta} + C\sin^{2}{\Theta} \cos{[2 (\Phi - \phi_{\text{exc}}})]\}\label{eq:scalarabs}
\end{align}
where
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  A &= \frac{1}{4} - \frac{3}{8} \cos{\alpha } + \frac{1}{8} \cos^{3}{\alpha }\\
  B &= \frac{3}{16} \cos{\alpha } - \frac{3}{16} \cos^{3}{\alpha }\\
  C &= \frac{7}{32} - \frac{3}{32} \cos{\alpha } - \frac{3}{32} \cos^{2}{\alpha } - \frac{1}{32} \cos^{3}{\alpha}\\
  D &= \frac{4}{3(1 - \cos\alpha)}.
\end{align}\label{eq:coefficients}%
\end{subequations}

At the beginning of this section we assumed that the molecule was located at
the focal point of the condenser. If the illumination objective is aplanatic
then we can relax this assumption and the above expressions are valid for
molecules anywhere in the focal plane.

We also assumed that we used incoherent K\"ohler illumination. If we illuminate
the back aperture with a weakly focused laser beam and scan the laser beam
slowly---if the scan velocity is much less than the beam waist divided by the
coherence time---we can ignore longitudinal excitation and the molecule will
be excited as if a single plane was incident. Therefore, we can find the
absorption efficiency of a molecule under weakly focused scanned laser
illumination by taking the limit of equation \ref{eq:scalarabs} as
$\alpha \rightarrow 0$ giving
\begin{align}
  \eta_{\text{abs}} &= \sin^2\Theta\cos^2(\Phi - \phi_{\text{exc}})
\end{align}
which is recognizable as Malus' law generalized to three dimensions. Notice that
the absorption efficiency can take its a maximum range of values
$\eta_{\text{abs}} \in [0, 1]$ when $\alpha=0$.

\subsection{Detection Efficiency}\label{detection}
Fourkas calculated the detection efficiency of a single molecule when an
objective with a polarizer is aligned along the $\mh{z}$ axis
\cite{fourkas2001}. We use his expressions to calculate the detection efficiency
without a polarizer as
\begin{align}
  \eta_{\text{det}} = 2(A + B\sin^2\Theta). \label{eq:scalardet}
\end{align}
The detection efficiency only depends on $\Theta$, not $\Phi$, because there is
no detection polarizer. We have assumed that the absorption dipole moment is
equal to the emission dipole moment.

Note that $A$ and $B$ in equation \ref{eq:coefficients} are a factor of
$\frac{3}{2}$ larger than the expressions given by Fourkas. We found that
Fourkas' expressions were incorrectly normalized (the limit of
$\eta_{\text{det}}$ as $\alpha\rightarrow \pi/2$ should be 1), and the extra
factor of $\frac{3}{2}$ corrects the error. This correction does not affect
Fourkas' orientation reconstruction but it does mean that Fourkas' algorithm
under predicts the total emitted intensity by a factor of $\frac{3}{2}$.

Also note that the detection efficiency can take its a maximum range of values
when $B$ takes its maximum value, i.e. when
$\alpha=\arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) \approx 54.7^{\circ}$. When $n = 1.33$,
this condition corresponds to $\text{NA} \approx 1.1$.

\subsection{Oblique Illumination and Detection}\label{oblique}
In sections \ref{excitation} and \ref{detection} we assumed that both the
illumination and detection objectives had $\mh{z}$ aligned optical axes. To extend
the forward model to oblique optical axes, we express the dipole orientation in
rotated coordinates using the following expressions
\begin{align}
    \Theta' &= \arccos\left(\sin\psi\cos\Phi\sin\Theta + \cos\psi\cos\Theta\right)\label{eq:thetap}\\
  \Phi' &=
          \begin{cases}
            \arccos\left(\dfrac{\cos\psi\cos\Phi\sin\Theta - \sin\psi\cos\Theta}{\sqrt{1 - (\sin\psi\cos\Phi\sin\Theta + \cos\psi\cos\Theta)^2}}\right) \ \ \ &0 \leq \Phi < \pi  \\
            -\arccos\left(\dfrac{\cos\psi\cos\Phi\sin\Theta - \sin\psi\cos\Theta}{\sqrt{1 - (\sin\psi\cos\Phi\sin\Theta + \cos\psi\cos\Theta)^2}}\right) \ \ \ &-\pi \leq \Phi < 0\\
          \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $\psi$ is the angle of a right handed rotation about the $\mh{y}$ that maps the $\mh{z}$ axis onto the new optical axis. 

\subsection{Single-Frame Microscopes}\label{forward}
The detected intensity is the product of the the sample exposure
$I_{\text{tot}}$, the absorption efficiency, and the detection efficiency
\begin{align}
  I = I_{\text{tot}}\eta_{\text{abs}}\eta_{\text{det}}\label{eq:forward_frame}.
\end{align}
Equation \ref{eq:forward_frame} is the forward model for a \emph{single-frame
  microscope}. Figure \ref{fig:single-frame} shows the efficiencies from three
representative examples of single-frame microscopes.

The intensity measured by a single-frame microscope does not give us enough
information to reconstruct the orientation of a single molecule. Next, we
will consider combining several single-frame microscopes to create
\emph{multi-frame microscopes.}

Note our distinction between \emph{frames} and \emph{views}. Frames refer to
single intensity measurements with fixed illumination, detection, and
polarization geometries. Views refers to the detection objectives, and multiview
microscopes use multiple detection objectives.

  detection ($\text{NA} = 0.8$). All simulations use $n=1.33$.}
  \label{fig:single-frame}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Multi-Frame Microscopes}\label{designs}
One way to collect multiple frames is to add a universal compensator to the
illumination arm and rapidly select the incident polarization by changing
$\phi_{\text{exc}}$ \cite{oldenbourg1995}. All of the multi-frame microscopes we
will consider in this paper use four frames per view with the illumination
polarization separated by 45${}^{\circ}$.

We also consider several dual-view designs. We evaluate two-view designs that
allow for illumination and detection from both objectives (see \cite{wu2013} for
a dual-view design). In all cases we consider the effect of varying the
illumination and detection numerical aperture. We also consider asymmetric NA
designs (see \cite{wu2017} for an asymmetric NA design) and the effect of
sample exposure.

All multiview microscopes are subject to steric constraints---the objectives
must not collide with the cover slip or each other. We only consider microscope
designs that meet these criteria.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}\label{metrics}
Our goal is to evaluate the ability of a microscope design to estimate the
orientation of a single molecule (via parameters $\Theta$ and $\Phi$) from
intensity data.

For each microscope design and molecule orientation we calculate the Fisher
information matrix. If the intensity is Poisson distributed the
Fisher information matrix is given by
\begin{align}
  \mb{F} &= \sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{I_k}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Theta}\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Theta}&\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Theta}\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Phi}\\\\
    \dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Theta}\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Phi}&\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Phi}\dfrac{\partial I_k}{\partial \Phi}\\    
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
where $I_k$ is the intensity measured in the $k$th frame of an $N$ frame
microscope.

A common way to evaluate the ability to estimate the parameters $\Theta$ and
$\Phi$ from the data is to calculate the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for each
parameter \cite{kay1993}. The CRLBs are given by the diagonal elements of the
inverse of the Fisher information matrix, and they give the minimum variance of
an unbiased estimator for each parameter. Agrawal et. al. used the square root
of the product of the CRLBs multiplied by the Jacobian determinant,
$\sin\Theta\sqrt{\mb{F}^{-1}_{0,0}\mb{F}^{-1}_{1,1}}$, to find the area of
uncertainty in parameter space \cite{agrawal2012}.

CRLBs and the associated area of uncertainty are parametrization dependent,
i.e., if we choose a different coordinate system these metrics will change. We
would like to compare microscope designs without choosing a parametrization, so
instead we use
\begin{align}
  \sigma_{\Omega} &\equiv \sin\Theta\sqrt{\text{det}\{\mb{F}^{-1}\}}
\end{align}
as our evaluation metric. We take the determinant of the inverse Fisher
information matrix---a parametrization independent value called the
\emph{generalized variance} \cite{anderson1958}---take the square root, then
multiply by the Jacobian determinant, $\sin\Theta$. We call $\sigma_{\Omega}$
the \emph{solid-angle uncertainty} because it has units of steradians and is a
parametrization independent measure of the orientation uncertainty.

For each multi-frame microscope we calculate $\sigma_{\Omega}$ at 10,000
approximately equally spaced points on the unit sphere. A desirable microscope
design will have a small solid-angle uncertainty that is uniform for all
molecule orientations. The most straightforward way to find the location and
scale of the solid-angle uncertainty is to use the mean and variance,
respectively. Because the solid-angle uncertainty admits extremely large values
that can change the mean and variance dramatically depending on the sample
points, we use the median and median absolute deviation (MAD)---the median of
the data's absolute difference from the median---as robust replacements for the
mean and variance.

To compare multi-frame microscopes with different numbers of frames fairly, we
kept the total exposure to the sample constant by choosing
$I_{\text{tot}} = \frac{4000}{N}$. Note that $I_{\text{tot}}$ is a measure of
exposure to the sample, not the detected intensity or the total intensity
emitted by the molecule.

\section{Results}\label{results}
Figure \ref{fig:single-arm} shows our results for single-view designs where a
single objective is used for illumination and detection. We swept through the
illumination and detection NA while keeping the sample exposure constant, and we
found that the lowest median and MAD of the solid-angle uncertainty occurs with
a small illumination NA and a large detection NA where
$\alpha \approx 57.4^{\circ}$. A small illumination NA maximizes the range of
absorption efficiencies, while a large detection NA maximizes the number of
detected photons and the range of the detection efficiencies. Note the relative
importance of illumination and detection NAs---reducing the illumination NA (an
inexpensive modification) improves the solid angle uncertainty much less than
increasing the detection NA (an expensive modification). Also note from Figure
\ref{fig:single-arm}b) that single-view designs suffer from high orientation
uncertainty when the molecules are oriented along the optical axis (because the
molecules are not efficiently excited) and in the transverse plane (because it
is ambiguous whether the molecule is oriented above or below the transverse
plane).

\label{fig:single-arm}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{fig:symmetric-widefield} and \ref{fig:double-arm} show our results
for dual-view designs. We illuminate from one objective and detect from the
other for four polarization frames, then we repeat the polarization frames with
the same objectives in reversed roles. In Figure \ref{fig:symmetric-widefield}
we sweep through the NA of both objectives and the angle between the objectives
while considering steric constraints. Note how adding a second view removes the
high uncertainty region in the transverse plane. The dual-view microscope still
has high uncertainty regions near the optical axes, but the uncertainty is
reduced compared to the single-view microscope. We find that the lowest median
of the solid-angle uncertainty occurs with the largest possible NA
objectives. We also find that increasing NA always lowers the MAD, but
orthogonal arms are not always best. At large NA, it is advantageous to move the
objectives together or against the cover slip. Given the high uncertainty in the
transverse plane for a single view shown in Figure \ref{fig:single-arm}b), we
can see why oblique views perform better than orthogonal views---oblique views
are complementary because the regions of high orientation of uncertainty from
each view do not overlap.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{symmetric-widefield}
\caption{Dual-view symmetric widefield designs with varying NA and angle between
  objectives. First we illuminate with the first objective (red solid) and
  detect from the second objective (red dashed). Then we illuminate from the
  second objective (blue solid) and detect from the first objective (blue
  dashed). See the Fig. \ref{fig:single-arm} caption for an explanation of
  b)-d).}
\label{fig:symmetric-widefield}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:double-arm} shows our results when we used a symmetric widefield
design and varied the illumination and detection NA. Our results are similar to
the single view case in Figure \ref{fig:single-arm}. We find that the best
designs use a small illumination NA and a large detection NA where
$\alpha \approx 57.4^{\circ}$. This means that dual view light sheet illumination
geometries are an excellent choice for uniformly reconstructing the orientation
of single molecules.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:double-arm}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:asymmetric-double} shows our results for asymmetric light sheet
illumination designs. We kept the two views orthogonal and used light sheet
illumination on both sides while sweeping through the NA asymmetry and the
sample exposure asymmetry while keeping the total sample exposure constant. We
found that symmetric designs are at a local minimum of the median and MAD of the
solid-angle uncertainty. We found that at extreme asymmetries where the exposure
from the low NA arm is much larger than the exposure from the high NA arm
(top-left and bottom-right corners of Figures \ref{fig:asymmetric-double}c) and
d)) the median and MAD are comparable to the symmetric light-sheet
microscope. This means that if a very high NA objective is available and a low
NA objective can provide light sheet illumination, this microscope will perform
comparably with a dual-view microscope with two objectives of medium NA. Figure
\ref{fig:asymmetric-double} also shows that designs with slightly asymmetric NA
can trade off a low solid-angle uncertainty median for a low solid-angle
uncertainty MAD by changing the sample exposure ratio.

  \caption{Asymmetric light-sheet illumination designs with varying NA and

    the illumination is represented by a dot instead of a solid line) and the
    Fig. \ref{fig:single-arm} caption for an explanation of b)-d).}

\end{figure}

% Figure \ref{fig:triple-arm} shows the results when we considered symmetric
% light-sheet designs with a lower detection arm. We swept through the NA of the

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{discussion}
% Fourkas' expressions underpredict the fraction of the total power collected by
% an objective with a polarizer by a constant fraction of
% $\frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, using Fourkas' expressions to find $I_{\text{tot}}$
% will result in overpredictions of $I_{\text{tot}}$, but the incorrect
% expressions will not cause any error in the predictions of molecular
% orientation.

% Lu and Bout \cite{lu2008} study the effect of noise on the reconstruction of single fluorophores using Fourkas' expressions. Their main results are unaffected by the correction introduced in these notes, but because these notes predict a higher intensity than Fourkas, Lu and Bout overpredict the effect of noise in their model.

In this work we have developed a model to predict the intensities measured by
polarized illumination microscopes in a wide range of geometries, developed
metrics to measure the ability of a microscope design to estimate the
orientation of single molecules, and used these metrics to compare a wide
range of microscope designs. Our main result is a short list of design
heuristics that can be used to design polarized illumination single molecule
orientation microscopes:
\begin{itemize}
\item All microscopes benefit from a small illumination NA and a large detection
  NA with $\alpha \approx 57.4^{\circ}$.
\item Dual-view microscopes outperform single-view microscopes, and dual-view
  microscopes remove the high uncertainty region in the transverse plane of
  single-view microscopes.
\item High NA dual-view microscopes are best when the two views are
  oblique. Oblique views are complementary because their high uncertainty
  transverse planes do not overlap.
\item Symmetric dual-view light-sheet illumination microscopes provide a good
  compromise between cost, solid-angle uncertainty median, and solid-angle
  uncertainty MAD. Asymmetric dual-view light-sheet illumination microscopes
  can improve the solid-angle uncertainty median or MAD by changing the sample
  exposure ratio between the two views.

Our results are limited in several ways. First, we only consider single
molecules in homogeneous environments. We ignore light reflected from the cover
slip and any other inhomogeneities in the sample. If we considered light
reflected from the cover slip we expect that the results would put a lower
weighting on large detection NAs because we would collect more light. Second, we
only considered ideal, polarization preserving, aplanatic objectives. In
practice, these conditions are not always satisfied and power from high NA rays
is reduced by a factor of $\frac{1}{\cos\Theta}$ \cite{nov2006}. Therefore, our
results are most accurate for low NA rays and get progressively worse for high
NA rays, although we our major conclusions would not change. The main advantage
of ignoring the power reduction of high NA rays is the tractability of the
problem. We have provided approximate closed form solutions for the illumination
and detection efficiencies that have allowed us to draw useful design
conclusions.

To compare the microscopes in this paper we used a fixed sample exposure. We
think that this is the fairest way to compare microscopes with different numbers
of frames. However, in cases where sample exposure and time are not an issue it
may be more useful to compare microscopes with the same detection exposure per
frame. This comparison would favor multiple frame microscopes even more that the
results in this paper, because equal detection exposure per frame would improve
photon counting statistics.

We have considered single- and dual-view microscopes in a variety of cases, but
more multiview microscopes can be analyzed with the framework we have
developed. Wu et. al. have developed a three view design with a third objection
below the cover slip\cite{wu2016}. Light-field detection schemes are also a type
of multiview microscope\cite{levoy2006}, and we plan to extend our analysis to
this case in future work.

Although we have only considered single molecule orientation determination in
this work, polarized illumination techniques can be applied to find the
distribution of ensembles of molecules \cite{mehta2016, backer2016}. In future
work we will investigate the ability of multiview polarized illumination
microscopes to estimate the orientation and distribution of ensembles of
molecules.

We conclude that multiview microscopes are useful tools for determining the
orientation of single molecules. Using simple design heuristics, we can design
polarized illumination multiview microscopes that can determine the orientation
of single molecules with a small and uniform orientation uncertainty.
